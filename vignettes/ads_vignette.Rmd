## Downloading Data Sets from Copernicus's Atmosphere Data Store

[Copernicus.eu](https://www.copernicus.eu/en) provides a set of interesting data sets for research, education, and applied earth sciences on their [Atmospheric Data Store](https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/) (ADS) as part of the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS). These data provide consistent information on the atmosphere anywhere in the world.

## Before Downloading Data

Before you will be able to download any data you need to get a free personal
account.

* [Register yourself for ADS services](https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/user/register)
* [Terms and conditions](https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/disclaimer-privacy)

To retrieve data `ecmwfr` use `wf_set_key()`to add the login details to your local keyring (requires the _R_ package [`keyring`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=keyring)).

Once you are in possession of your personal user (namely your user ID and a secret key) `ecmwfr` allows to send requests to CDS and/or download the data.

## The Request Syntax

ADS data retrievals are based on a `list` object which specifies the data set to be downloaded.  These definitions are called `requests` (for those who are familiar with _mars_: these are basically _mars_ requests). A `request` defined the type of the `dataset`, the `variables` to be downloaded, the time period, output `format`, `target` location, a custom `area` extent, and other details.

The request syntax is available for a range of different CDS data sets. Check the [ADS Dataset](https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/search?type=dataset) website to see a list of available datasets and to check whether API requests are allowed or not (go to _Download Data_, select some data, show request by clicking _Show API Request_ (red button, bottom of page).

The conversion from a python based string to the list format can be automated if you use the RStudio based Addin. By selecting and using Addin -> python to list (or 'Mars to list') you dynamically convert queries copied from either ECMWF or CDS based services.

### A CAMS example

```{r demo request, echo = TRUE}
# Specify the data set
request <- list(
  date = "2003-01-01/2003-01-01",
  format = "netcdf",
  variable = "particulate_matter_2.5um",
  time = "00:00",
  dataset_short_name = "cams-global-reanalysis-eac4",
  target = "particulate_matter.nc"
)
```

This request downloads global re-analysis data on particulate matter on January first 2003.

The data set as specified above can be downloaded calling the
`wf_request` function:

```{r spatial-request, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Start downloading the data, the path of the file
# will be returned as a variable (ncfile)
file <- wf_request(
  user     = "2345",   # user ID (for authentification)
  request  = request,  # the request
  transfer = TRUE,     # download the file
  path     = "."       # store data in current working directory
  )
```

Depending on the request (the amount of data you are asking for) the request function may take a while! Please note: if you try to download larger amounts of data it is suggested to split the data sets, e.g., download year-by-year, or even month-by-month, if you are trying to download several variables/fields.

Once the retrieval has finished you should now be the owner of a NetCDF containing the requested information located in the current working directory, called `particulate_matter.nc`. 

Quick check:

```{r spatial-plot, echo = TRUE, figure = TRUE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6, eval = eval}
# Open NetCDF file and plot
# the log transformed data
r <- terra::rast(ncfile)
terra::plot(log(rotate(r)),
             main = "CAMS reanalysis data (particulate matter 2.5u)",
             col = rev(heat.colors(100)))
maps::map("world", add = TRUE)
```
