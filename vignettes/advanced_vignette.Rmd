# Advanced Use Cases

This is a brief overview of some of the more advanced options in the `ecmwfr` package.

## Setup

A 'hidden' feature of the `wf_set_key()` function is that it returns the user name upon succes. This allows for easier integration in scripts shared with users (which have different credentials)

```{r eval = FALSE}
# set a key to the keychain interactively
user <- wf_set_key(service = "webapi")
```

## Formatting requests 

The conversion from a MARS or python based queries (formed on the ECMWF or Copernicus CDS websites) to the list format used by `ecmwfr` can be automated if you use the RStudio based Addin. 

By selecting and using Addin -> Mars to list (or 'Python to list') you dynamically convert queries copied from either ECMWF or CDS based services.

Using the `Addin` is the sure way to form a proper `ecmwfr` request and avoids typos. As such, we recommend the use of the `Addin`.

## Piped requests

Another hidden feature of `ecmwfr` is the fact that the request is the first argument in the `wf_request()` function. This means that any valid list can be piped into this function (using the %>% or pipe symbol).

```{r eval = FALSE}
list(stream  = "oper",
     levtype = "sfc",
     param   = "167.128",
     dataset = "interim",
     step    = "0",
     grid    = "0.75/0.75",
     time    = "00",
     date    = "2014-07-01/to/2014-07-02",
     type    = "an",
     class   = "ei",
     area    = "73.5/-27/33/45",
     format  = "netcdf",
     target  = "tmp.nc") %>%
  wf_request(user = user, path = "~")
````

## Dynamic request functions / archetypes

Once a valid request has been created it can be made into a dynamic function using `achetypes`. Archetype functions are build using a valid `ecmwfr` ECMWF or CDS request and the vector naming the field which are to be set as dynamic.

The `wf_archetype()` function creates a new function with as parameters the dynamic fields previously assigned. The below example show how to use the function to generate the custom `dynamic_request()` function. We then use this new function to alter the `area` and `date` fields and pipe (%>%) into the `wf_request()` function to retrieve the data.

```{r eval = TRUE}
# this is an example of a request
dynamic_request <- wf_archetype(request = list(
  stream  = "oper",
  levtype = "sfc",
  param   = "167.128",
  dataset = "interim",
  step    = "0",
  grid    = "0.75/0.75",
  time    = "00",
  date    = "2014-07-01/to/2014-07-02",
  type    = "an",
  class   = "ei",
  area    = "73.5/-27/33/45",
  format  = "netcdf",
  target  = "tmp.nc"),
  dynamic_fields = c("area","date"))

# change only the date to a single day
dynamic_request(date = "2014-07-01")
```
